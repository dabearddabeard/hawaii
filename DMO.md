Good Afternoon Mr. Hopkins,

Thank you for your prompt response. To clarify, our newborn has not yet arrived; therefore, we are comfortable with the infant traveling as a lap child. We prefer to proceed with the booking now, rather than waiting for the newborn's entire dependent process to complete: entry of birth certificate through DEERS, registering the infant as a dependent in the USMC system, and then modifying the orders to list the newborn. 

v/r, <br>
Maj Beard

Maj Beard,

  If your newborn is listed on your orders, that newborn rates a seat as well.

Thanks,

H.

- TYPE: Dog
- BREED: American Eskimo
- GENDER: Female
- AGE: 13
- PET/CAGE WEIGHT: 20 lbs
- CAGE DIMENSIONS (LxWxH in inches): 20 x 17 x 12
- CAGE DESCRIPTION: Soft-sided with rollers, designed to fit under the seat

Please inform us if you require any additional information from our side to facilitate these arrangements. Thank you again!

v/r, <br>
David A. Beard <br>

Thank you DMO/Mr Hopkins,

To David Beard, I just need to know if I need to rebook the family now and they will then update the airline with lap infant. Or if we need hold off until the baby is born?

And if rebooking with the pet we will need breed/weight/kennel dimensions (hard or soft sided).

Good Afternoon DMO Team,

I write to request your approval for an increase in the ticket price to accommodate our family pet in the cabin during our relocation to Kaneohe, Hawaii, on May 6, 2024. Upon reviewing our travel options, we discovered that Alaska Airlines allows pets in the cabin and to Hawaii, offering a government rate from BWI. However, this option necessitates $220 per ticket.

Furthermore, we expect a newborn addition to our family, who, if permitted, can travel as a lap infant. CWTSatoTravel has informed us that adding a traveler after creating an itinerary necessitates rebooking. We aim to make all necessary adjustments to include our newborn.

Our family is available for travel between May 1 and 6, 2024, which provides us with the flexibility to book with Alaska Airlines during this period, pending your approval.

We acknowledge the requirement for DMO approval to use a non-contract carrier and the related cost increase. We believe the inclusion of our newborn and the safety of our family, including our pet, justify this request.

We would greatly appreciate your guidance and approval on proceeding with these arrangements. We are ready to provide any additional information or documentation required.

Thank you for considering our request and for your support in facilitating our family's travel needs during this relocation.

Good afternoon,

The 2nd question needs to be run by DMO. But we cannot add travelers to an itinerary once it is created, this itinerary would need to be rebooked once the infant has a birth certificate or can travel as a lap infant (this needed to be called in to the airline by the passenger). If adding a seated passenger you would not want to issue these tickets. A new record must be prepared including the name of the new traveler.

Pets are not permitted on Southwest flights to Hawaii. Alaskan does take pets in cabin and hold to Hawaii and has a gov rate from BWI but that would increase the price per ticket $220 per passenger. This can be changed with DMO approval for use of the non contract carrier.

Please let us know how to proceed,

Good Afternoon,

In the attached Port-Call Request, which was sent in the email below, information regarding a pet is included. I am verifying that it is permissible for a small dog to accompany a passenger in the cabin on the flights and that this arrangement has been included in the flight reservation before the commercial flight is ticketed.

Furthermore, I have attached a Medical Certification of Pregnancy as additional documentation concerning a newborn who will be joining the family on March 4, 2024. This will increase the number of travelers to four at the time of the flight on May 6, 2024. According to DTR Part I, Chapter 103, Paragraph J, in-lap passengers are not authorized on AMC flights, as all passengers, including infants and small children, must occupy separate seats. Does this regulation also apply to commercial flights? May we proceed with booking the tickets and completing the Port-Call Request process, anticipating the addition of a fourth traveler?

Attached:

- <`D._A._BEARD_Port_Call_Request.pdf`>
- <`U_ER_Medical-Certification-of-Pregnancy_F_20230102_U.pdf`> This is a medical certification of pregnancy for Sarah Beard, the wife of David A. Beard. The document has been duly filled out and signed by Sarah's health care provider.

Thank you for the support!

CWTSatoTravel is unable to issue your ticket for one of the following reasons: missing form of payment, missing travel order/authorization. If you need assistance contact CWTSatoTravel.

Attached is the flight reservation (commercial itinerary).
