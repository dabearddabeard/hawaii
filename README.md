## Marine On-Line (MOL) Outbound Interview (OBI)

All Marines in receipt of PCS orders will utilize the OBI module within MOL. This will cover all information needed by IPAC/admin to finalize PCS orders. This will also determine your travel entitlements. The OBI is needed to start the flight booking process. Be sure to include your pet(s) in your OBI. See "Schedule Flights" section.

## POV

The government covers the cost of shipping one vehicle to Hawaii. Shipping additional vehicles costs about $1,000 from the west coast and $2,000 from the east coast, varying by vehicle type. Some families choose to store a second vehicle on the mainland. Living on base may make managing with one vehicle feasible. Alternatively, purchasing an inexpensive 'island car' from the base's lemon lot is a common choice for those needing a second vehicle.

## Schedule Flights with PTO

> PTO is usually located within DMO


<details>
  <summary>CLICK TO EXPAND Process</summary>

<br>

The following steps explain the flight booking process.

Upon receiving PCS orders, you can initiate the flight process:
1. Complete your Outbound Interview (OBI) through your MOL Account
2. Research commercial flight options including options for pets if needed and ensure that the port call paragraph is in your PCS orders.
3. Contact your local IPAC/S-1 to submit your port call to SATO travel office to reserve your flights. If traveling with pets, ask about availability of alternative commercial flights to accommodate pet shipping.
4. There is a difference between having reservations for your commercial flight and being ticketed for your commercial flight. Your reservation (commercial itinerary) will be forwarded to you for your flight. If everything is correct such as location, spelling of names, and birthdates, the traveler will call the Travel Management Company (SATO) to purchase tickets. Once your flight is paid for, a commercial ticket will be issued. This travel is normally paid for (with your GTCC) and ticketed within 72 hours (3 business days) prior to departure OR on a case-by-case basis at the Marine's request upon detaching from your unit if earlier ticketing is needed.


Things to consider:
- Are you taking leave? Schedule your LICWO (Leave in Conjunction with Orders) travel.
- Are you storing a vehicle? You have the option to leave from the VPC (Vehicle Processing Center).

## Pet Importation

All pets entering Hawaii are subject to quarantine. However, preparing in advance and understanding the requirements can significantly reduce the waiting period. The DoD offers up to $550 in reimbursement for quarantine expenses.

<details>
  <summary>CLICK TO EXPAND Dog Process</summary>

<br>

To ensure a smooth process for bringing your pets into Hawaii, follow these guidelines:

1. **Shortened Quarantine Requirements**: For a quarantine period of five days or less, visit [here for the necessary requirements](http://hdoa.hawaii.gov/ai/aqs/faq-for-five-day-or-less-program/). Failure to meet these criteria may result in your pet being quarantined for up to 120 days.

2. **Important Documentation and Restrictions**: Consult the [Brochure and Prohibited Animals](http://hdoa.hawaii.gov/ai/files/2013/01/aqsbrochure.pdf) document, starting on page 15, to review the "Dog And Cat Import Form", AQS-278.

3. **Veterinary Appointment**: Schedule a consultation with your local Veterinarian, ideally at a military Veterinarian Treatment facility (VTF) if available, as they are typically more familiar with the specific requirements for pet importation into Hawaii.

4. **Official Import Guide**: Familiarize yourself with the official guide for importing cats and dogs into Hawaii by visiting [this link](http://hdoa.hawaii.gov/ai/aqs/aqs-info/). The website provides a detailed checklist of all necessary requirements for importing your pet. It is advisable to have this checklist on hand during your veterinary appointment.

Please be aware that owning pets is considered a privilege, not a right. You are responsible for all risks and costs associated with your pet's transportation. However, mandatory pet quarantine fees incurred as part of the mandatory quarantine process for a household pet are reimbursable, with a limit of $550 per Permanent Change of Station (PCS) move for pets quarantined on or after December 28, 2001. It's important to note that there is no reimbursement or allowance for the transportation costs of a pet. According to the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR), paragraph 050106, only quarantine expenses for dogs and cats are eligible for reimbursement.

## Inbound Process

### Guidance for Arrivals with Family

Upon arrival with your family, secure accommodations at [The Inns of the Corps](https://goo.gl/maps/mUwxC7tu7cCzGZfy8), the designated temporary lodging facility on Marine Corps Base Hawaii (MCBH). Should the Inns be fully booked, obtain a statement of non-availability from them. This documentation is necessary if you seek to stay in non-military lodging, which must be approved by the Temporary Lodging Allowance (TLA) office to ensure compliance with TLA-approved accommodations.

### Reporting Obligations

<details>
  <summary>CLICK TO EXPAND Details</summary>
    
<br>

Within three days of your arrival, it is mandatory to report to the Family Housing Office and the Installation Personnel Administration Center (IPAC). When reporting, ensure you have the following documents:

- Endorsed copies of your original orders.
- Detaching and reporting endorsements.
- Travel vouchers and related documents.

In line with Marine Corps Order (MCO) 11000.22, all military personnel assigned to MCBH are required to consult the Family Housing Office prior to engaging in any off-base housing lease agreements or purchasing property. This step ensures compliance with base housing policies and supports the efficient transition into your new assignment.

Hello, my name is Allie Pilkington, and I serve as the Program Manager for Information Referral at Marine Corps Base Hawaii. I would like to provide you with a concise overview of the Marine and Family Programs division.

Marine and Family Programs is a division of the Marine Corps Community Services (MCCS), dedicated to supporting Marines, Sailors, and their families through a wide range of services.

The division comprises several departments: Family Readiness, Family Care, Personal and Professional Readiness, and Behavioral Health.

Firstly, Marine Corps Family Team Building and Family Readiness offer L.I.N.K.S. classes, life skills and readiness training, deployment support, and family readiness programs.

The Family Care Resource and Referral serves as a point of contact for Child and Youth Programs, the Child Development Center, Child Care, the Exceptional Family Member Program, and the School Liaison Program. Contact information for these services is readily available.

Behavioral Health provides a variety of programs, including Family Advocacy, Community Counseling, New Parent Support, Sexual Assault Prevention, and Substance Abuse. Contact details and additional information can be found on their website.

Our department, Information Referral and Relocation Services, offers services such as the lending locker, new arrivals orientation (soon to be available on the MCCS website), PCS and Moving Workshops, Sponsorship Training Classes, and Sponsorship Coordinator Training. Lending locker appointments, which are available free of charge for kitchen essentials during PCS, can be made by contacting us directly.

Miss Mary Healy oversees the library, which offers a wealth of resources including books, DVDs, CDs, GoPros, telescopes, and access to computers, printers, fax machines, and copiers.

Mr. Craig Lockwood is responsible for the Education Center, and Deborah Blunt manages the Personal Financial Management program. Marines arriving at their first duty station are required to complete the Personal Readiness Seminar within 90 days through Joint Knowledge Online.

Mr. Jeff Esposito is the contact for the Transition Readiness Program, providing essential information for those transitioning out of service.

An aerial view highlights the proximity of the Education Center, Transition Assistance, and the Library, facilitating easy access to these services.

Miss Marie Calvo runs the Family Member Employment Assistance program, offering employment support for family members of Marines, Sailors, Reservists, and Retirees.

Our Information Referral and Relocation Services are located in Building 579 on Reed Road, near the Officers Club, alongside other important services such as Marine Corps Family Team Building, FEMAP, FOCUS, and Head Start.

<br>

Active Duty personnel with command-sponsored dependents attached to Marine Corps Base Hawaii (MCBH) can apply online in advance, provided they submit the proper documentation. The required documents include:

- [DD Form 1746 (Application for Assignment to Housing)](DDForm1746.pdf)
- [A copy of Permanent Change of Station (PCS) orders (web orders)](#)
- [Registered Sex Offender Disclosure Statement](FamilyHousingRegisteredSexOffender_digisg.pdf)
- [MCBH Family Housing Applicant's Statement of Understanding (SOU)](FamilyHousingSOU_digsig.pdf)
- [Privacy Act Release Letter](PrivacyActReleaseLetter_digsig.pdf)

Applicants must complete all required paperwork and submit the application and documents to the email address or fax number provided. Upon receipt, a Housing Counselor will be assigned to you and will respond via email within 24-48 business hours to confirm the acceptance and processing of your application.

Ensure that your full Social Security Number (SSN) appears on the application, not your Electronic Data Interchange Personal Identifier (EDIPI). Sign in blocks 22 and 25. The active duty service member must sign all documents; if a spouse is signing on the service member's behalf, a Power of Attorney is required. It is not necessary to complete blocks 16-19. It is crucial to include personal email addresses and contact numbers for both the service member and spouse in the remarks area. Unfortunately, Ohana/Hunt does not support iCloud accounts; therefore, you will need to provide an alternative email address to receive email communication from them. You may also select a Neighborhood of Choice (NOC) or inform Ohana/Hunt of your preferred NOC when they contact you.
 
Apply to [Ohana Hunt Military Communities](http://www.ohanamarinecorpscommunities.com/application) housing as soon as we receive orders because the waiting list can span several months. Many homes offer ocean views or are situated mere blocks from the beach, fostering an excellent community of spouses. The utilities included are water, sewer, trash removal, and average electricity usage. However, residents are responsible for cable, phone, internet, and any charges exceeding the average, as per the Resident Energy Conservation Program (RECP). The current wait times for ranks O4-O5 and W5, which commence upon arrival on the island, are as follows:

- Mololani: 6-12 months
- Kapoho and Kaluapuni: 12+ months
- Manana (4-bedroom only): 3-6 months
- Nani Ulupau (4-bedroom only): 9-12 months
- Camp Smith: 6-12 months.

- Absence of Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)
- Competitive interest rates

## Monthly Budget Breakdown
- **Total Monthly Budget:** $4,380
- **Utilities:** $711.87
- **Remaining for Mortgage, Taxes, and Insurance:** $4,380 - $711.87 = $3,668.13

## Calculating Property Taxes and Insurance
- **Annual Property Taxes and Insurance Rate:** 1.55%
- Estimating on a monthly basis, divide the annual rate by 12.

## Mortgage Details
- **Interest Rate:** 3.5% annually
- **Loan Term:** 30 years (360 months)
- **Down Payment:** $0

```python

# Initialize constants
TOTAL_MONTHLY_BUDGET = 3668.13
ANNUAL_TAX_INSURANCE_RATE_DECIMAL = 1.55 / 100  # Convert percentage to decimal
ANNUAL_INTEREST_RATE_DECIMAL = 3.5 / 100  # Convert percentage to decimal
LOAN_TERM_YEARS = 30
LOAN_TERM_MONTHS = LOAN_TERM_YEARS * 12

# Calculate the monthly cost of property tax and insurance
# Note: This calculation assumes the loan amount equals the home value
HOME_VALUE_PLACEHOLDER = 100  # Placeholder for calculating rate impact
annual_tax_and_insurance = HOME_VALUE_PLACEHOLDER * ANNUAL_TAX_INSURANCE_RATE_DECIMAL
monthly_tax_and_insurance = annual_tax_and_insurance / 12

# Calculate the monthly mortgage payment, excluding taxes and insurance
monthly_mortgage_payment_excl = TOTAL_MONTHLY_BUDGET - monthly_tax_and_insurance

# Determine the monthly interest rate
monthly_interest_rate = ANNUAL_INTEREST_RATE_DECIMAL / 12

# Calculate the loan amount using the mortgage payment formula:
# P = (r * PV) / (1 - (1 + r)^-n), where P is the monthly payment, r is the monthly interest rate,
# PV is the present value (loan amount), and n is the loan term in months.
# The formula is rearranged to solve for PV (loan amount).
loan_amount = monthly_mortgage_payment_excl * (1 - (1 + monthly_interest_rate) ** -LOAN_TERM_MONTHS) / monthly_interest_rate

# Output the calculated loan amount
print(f"Calculated Loan Amount: {loan_amount}")
# Calculated Loan Amount: 816845.3904291481

```
