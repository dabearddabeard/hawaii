### Cars

The government covers the cost of shipping one vehicle to Hawaii. Shipping additional vehicles costs about $1,000 from the west coast and $2,000 from the east coast, varying by vehicle type. Some families choose to store a second vehicle on the mainland. Living on base may make managing with one vehicle feasible. Alternatively, purchasing an inexpensive 'island car' from the base's lemon lot is a common choice for those needing a second vehicle.

        Hello, my name is Allie Pilkington, and I serve as the Program Manager for Information Referral at Marine Corps Base Hawaii. I would like to provide you with a concise overview of the Marine and Family Programs division.
        
        Marine and Family Programs is a division of the Marine Corps Community Services (MCCS), dedicated to supporting Marines, Sailors, and their families through a wide range of services.
        
        The division comprises several departments: Family Readiness, Family Care, Personal and Professional Readiness, and Behavioral Health.
        
        Firstly, Marine Corps Family Team Building and Family Readiness offer L.I.N.K.S. classes, life skills and readiness training, deployment support, and family readiness programs.
        
        The Family Care Resource and Referral serves as a point of contact for Child and Youth Programs, the Child Development Center, Child Care, the Exceptional Family Member Program, and the School Liaison Program. Contact information for these services is readily available.
        
        Behavioral Health provides a variety of programs, including Family Advocacy, Community Counseling, New Parent Support, Sexual Assault Prevention, and Substance Abuse. Contact details and additional information can be found on their website.
        
        Our department, Information Referral and Relocation Services, offers services such as the lending locker, new arrivals orientation (soon to be available on the MCCS website), PCS and Moving Workshops, Sponsorship Training Classes, and Sponsorship Coordinator Training. Lending locker appointments, which are available free of charge for kitchen essentials during PCS, can be made by contacting us directly.
        
        Miss Mary Healy oversees the library, which offers a wealth of resources including books, DVDs, CDs, GoPros, telescopes, and access to computers, printers, fax machines, and copiers.
        
        Mr. Craig Lockwood is responsible for the Education Center, and Deborah Blunt manages the Personal Financial Management program. Marines arriving at their first duty station are required to complete the Personal Readiness Seminar within 90 days through Joint Knowledge Online.
        
        Mr. Jeff Esposito is the contact for the Transition Readiness Program, providing essential information for those transitioning out of service.
        
        An aerial view highlights the proximity of the Education Center, Transition Assistance, and the Library, facilitating easy access to these services.
        
        Miss Marie Calvo runs the Family Member Employment Assistance program, offering employment support for family members of Marines, Sailors, Reservists, and Retirees.
        
        Our Information Referral and Relocation Services are located in Building 579 on Reed Road, near the Officers Club, alongside other important services such as Marine Corps Family Team Building, FEMAP, FOCUS, and Head Start.
        
        For further inquiries, please contact us at 808-257-7786, visit our Facebook page, or explore our website.

## Military Housing for Kaneohe Bay Hawaii Marine Corps Base

Please be advised that any email or attachment containing sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII), such as Social Security numbers, dates of birth, home addresses, telephone numbers, marital status, names of family members, or sex offender status, must be sent via an official Department of Defense (DoD) email. Furthermore, it must be encrypted and digitally signed in accordance with DoD policy. This requirement pertains to sensitive PII included in documents such as the DD Form 1746, "Application for Assignment to Housing," Registered Sex Offender forms, and any other forms or information provided to the Family Housing Office. The transmission of this type of information through unencrypted or personal email is unauthorized and poses a risk of exposing sensitive information to entities that may use it for malicious purposes.

Active Duty personnel with command-sponsored dependents attached to Marine Corps Base Hawaii (MCBH) can apply online in advance, provided they submit the proper documentation. The required documents include:

- [DD Form 1746 (Application for Assignment to Housing)](DDForm1746.pdf)
- [A copy of Permanent Change of Station (PCS) orders (web orders)](#)
- [Registered Sex Offender Disclosure Statement](FamilyHousingRegisteredSexOffender_digisg.pdf)
- [MCBH Family Housing Applicant's Statement of Understanding (SOU)](FamilyHousingSOU_digsig.pdf)
- [Privacy Act Release Letter](PrivacyActReleaseLetter_digsig.pdf)

Applicants must complete all required paperwork and submit the application and documents to the email address or fax number provided. Upon receipt, a Housing Counselor will be assigned to you and will respond via email within 24-48 business hours to confirm the acceptance and processing of your application.

Ensure that your full Social Security Number (SSN) appears on the application, not your Electronic Data Interchange Personal Identifier (EDIPI). Sign in blocks 22 and 25. The active duty service member must sign all documents; if a spouse is signing on the service member's behalf, a Power of Attorney is required. It is not necessary to complete blocks 16-19. It is crucial to include personal email addresses and contact numbers for both the service member and spouse in the remarks area. Unfortunately, Ohana/Hunt does not support iCloud accounts; therefore, you will need to provide an alternative email address to receive email communication from them. You may also select a Neighborhood of Choice (NOC) or inform Ohana/Hunt of your preferred NOC when they contact you.
 
Apply to [Ohana Hunt Military Communities](http://www.ohanamarinecorpscommunities.com/application) housing as soon as we receive orders because the waiting list can span several months. Many homes offer ocean views or are situated mere blocks from the beach, fostering an excellent community of spouses. The utilities included are water, sewer, trash removal, and average electricity usage. However, residents are responsible for cable, phone, internet, and any charges exceeding the average, as per the Resident Energy Conservation Program (RECP). The current wait times for ranks O4-O5 and W5, which commence upon arrival on the island, are as follows:

- Mololani: 6-12 months
- Kapoho and Kaluapuni: 12+ months
- Manana (4-bedroom only): 3-6 months
- Nani Ulupau (4-bedroom only): 9-12 months
- Camp Smith: 6-12 months.

```python

# Initialize constants
TOTAL_MONTHLY_BUDGET = 3668.13
ANNUAL_TAX_INSURANCE_RATE_DECIMAL = 1.55 / 100  # Convert percentage to decimal
ANNUAL_INTEREST_RATE_DECIMAL = 3.5 / 100  # Convert percentage to decimal
LOAN_TERM_YEARS = 30
LOAN_TERM_MONTHS = LOAN_TERM_YEARS * 12

# Calculate the monthly cost of property tax and insurance
# Note: This calculation assumes the loan amount equals the home value
HOME_VALUE_PLACEHOLDER = 100  # Placeholder for calculating rate impact
annual_tax_and_insurance = HOME_VALUE_PLACEHOLDER * ANNUAL_TAX_INSURANCE_RATE_DECIMAL
monthly_tax_and_insurance = annual_tax_and_insurance / 12

# Calculate the monthly mortgage payment, excluding taxes and insurance
monthly_mortgage_payment_excl = TOTAL_MONTHLY_BUDGET - monthly_tax_and_insurance

# Determine the monthly interest rate
monthly_interest_rate = ANNUAL_INTEREST_RATE_DECIMAL / 12

# Calculate the loan amount using the mortgage payment formula:
# P = (r * PV) / (1 - (1 + r)^-n), where P is the monthly payment, r is the monthly interest rate,
# PV is the present value (loan amount), and n is the loan term in months.
# The formula is rearranged to solve for PV (loan amount).
loan_amount = monthly_mortgage_payment_excl * (1 - (1 + monthly_interest_rate) ** -LOAN_TERM_MONTHS) / monthly_interest_rate

# Output the calculated loan amount
print(f"Calculated Loan Amount: {loan_amount}")
# Calculated Loan Amount: 816845.3904291481
