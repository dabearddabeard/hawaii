### Monthly Budget: $4,380

1. **Interest Rate**: 3.5%
2. **Loan Term**: 30 years
3. **Down Payment**: $0
4. **VA Funding Fee**: Approximately 2.3% for first-time use without a down payment, but this can be rolled into the loan amount, so exclude it from the monthly payment calculation.
5. **Property Taxes and Insurance**: Assume combined property taxes and insurance are roughly 1.55% of the home's value per year (1.2% for taxes + 0.35% for insurance, as mentioned). For simplicity, estimate this on a monthly basis as part of the overall budget.

### Calculation:

- **Estimated Monthly Payment for Principal and Interest**: Using the total monthly budget, subtract an estimated amount for taxes and insurance. For a home valued at $600,000, property taxes (1.2%) would be approximately $7,200/year or $600/month, and insurance (0.35%) would be about $2,100/year or $175/month. So, $600 (taxes) + $175 (insurance) = $775/month for taxes and insurance.
- **Available for P&I**: $4,380 - $775 = $3,605

3.5% interest rate, a 30-year term, and setting the monthly payment to $3,605 for principal and interest, allows to back into an approximate loan amount. This is a simplification and the exact numbers will vary based on specific tax rates, insurance costs, and the final VA funding fee rolled into the loan.

For a rough estimate, with a monthly allocation of $3,605 for principal and interest, we will be looking at a loan amount around **$800,000 to $900,000**, assuming the rest of your budget covers taxes, insurance, and any applicable VA funding fee. This would correspond to a purchase price in a similar range, given the $0 down payment feature of VA loans.
