        Hello, my name is Allie Pilkington, and I serve as the Program Manager for Information Referral at Marine Corps Base Hawaii. I would like to provide you with a concise overview of the Marine and Family Programs division.
        
        Marine and Family Programs is a division of the Marine Corps Community Services (MCCS), dedicated to supporting Marines, Sailors, and their families through a wide range of services.
        
        The division comprises several departments: Family Readiness, Family Care, Personal and Professional Readiness, and Behavioral Health.
        
        Firstly, Marine Corps Family Team Building and Family Readiness offer L.I.N.K.S. classes, life skills and readiness training, deployment support, and family readiness programs.
        
        The Family Care Resource and Referral serves as a point of contact for Child and Youth Programs, the Child Development Center, Child Care, the Exceptional Family Member Program, and the School Liaison Program. Contact information for these services is readily available.
        
        Behavioral Health provides a variety of programs, including Family Advocacy, Community Counseling, New Parent Support, Sexual Assault Prevention, and Substance Abuse. Contact details and additional information can be found on their website.
        
        Our department, Information Referral and Relocation Services, offers services such as the lending locker, new arrivals orientation (soon to be available on the MCCS website), PCS and Moving Workshops, Sponsorship Training Classes, and Sponsorship Coordinator Training. Lending locker appointments, which are available free of charge for kitchen essentials during PCS, can be made by contacting us directly.
        
        Miss Mary Healy oversees the library, which offers a wealth of resources including books, DVDs, CDs, GoPros, telescopes, and access to computers, printers, fax machines, and copiers.
        
        Mr. Craig Lockwood is responsible for the Education Center, and Deborah Blunt manages the Personal Financial Management program. Marines arriving at their first duty station are required to complete the Personal Readiness Seminar within 90 days through Joint Knowledge Online.
        
        Mr. Jeff Esposito is the contact for the Transition Readiness Program, providing essential information for those transitioning out of service.
        
        An aerial view highlights the proximity of the Education Center, Transition Assistance, and the Library, facilitating easy access to these services.
        
        Miss Marie Calvo runs the Family Member Employment Assistance program, offering employment support for family members of Marines, Sailors, Reservists, and Retirees.
        
        Our Information Referral and Relocation Services are located in Building 579 on Reed Road, near the Officers Club, alongside other important services such as Marine Corps Family Team Building, FEMAP, FOCUS, and Head Start.

- **ZIP Code:** 96863
- **CY24 O-4 with Dependents Allowance:** $4,380

If you are planning to live off base, visit [www.Homes.mil](www.Homes.mil).

### VA Loan Benefits

- No down payment requirement
- Absence of Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)
- Competitive interest rates

### Monthly Budget Breakdown
- **Total Monthly Budget:** $4,380
- **Utilities:** $711.87
- **Remaining for Mortgage, Taxes, and Insurance:** $4,380 - $711.87 = $3,668.13

### Calculating Property Taxes and Insurance
- **Annual Property Taxes and Insurance Rate:** 1.55%
- Estimating on a monthly basis, divide the annual rate by 12.

### Mortgage Details
- **Interest Rate:** 3.5% annually
- **Loan Term:** 30 years (360 months)
- **Down Payment:** $0

```python

# Initialize constants
TOTAL_MONTHLY_BUDGET = 3668.13
ANNUAL_TAX_INSURANCE_RATE_DECIMAL = 1.55 / 100  # Convert percentage to decimal
ANNUAL_INTEREST_RATE_DECIMAL = 3.5 / 100  # Convert percentage to decimal
LOAN_TERM_YEARS = 30
LOAN_TERM_MONTHS = LOAN_TERM_YEARS * 12

# Calculate the monthly cost of property tax and insurance
# Note: This calculation assumes the loan amount equals the home value
HOME_VALUE_PLACEHOLDER = 100  # Placeholder for calculating rate impact
annual_tax_and_insurance = HOME_VALUE_PLACEHOLDER * ANNUAL_TAX_INSURANCE_RATE_DECIMAL
monthly_tax_and_insurance = annual_tax_and_insurance / 12

# Calculate the monthly mortgage payment, excluding taxes and insurance
monthly_mortgage_payment_excl = TOTAL_MONTHLY_BUDGET - monthly_tax_and_insurance

# Determine the monthly interest rate
monthly_interest_rate = ANNUAL_INTEREST_RATE_DECIMAL / 12

# Calculate the loan amount using the mortgage payment formula:
# P = (r * PV) / (1 - (1 + r)^-n), where P is the monthly payment, r is the monthly interest rate,
# PV is the present value (loan amount), and n is the loan term in months.
# The formula is rearranged to solve for PV (loan amount).
loan_amount = monthly_mortgage_payment_excl * (1 - (1 + monthly_interest_rate) ** -LOAN_TERM_MONTHS) / monthly_interest_rate

# Output the calculated loan amount
print(f"Calculated Loan Amount: {loan_amount}")
# Calculated Loan Amount: 816845.3904291481

```

Based on the provided information and calculations, the home loan amount, considering the total budget of $3,668.13 for mortgage, taxes, and insurance, is approximately **$816,845.39**
