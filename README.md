```python

# Given data
total_monthly_budget_for_mortgage_taxes_insurance = 3668.13
annual_property_taxes_and_insurance_rate = 1.55 / 100  # converting percentage to decimal
annual_interest_rate = 3.5 / 100  # converting percentage to decimal
loan_term_years = 30
loan_term_months = loan_term_years * 12

# Calculating the monthly property tax and insurance cost
# Assuming the loan amount is the home value for this calculation
home_value = 100  # placeholder value to calculate the rate effect
annual_property_taxes_and_insurance = home_value * annual_property_taxes_and_insurance_rate
monthly_property_taxes_and_insurance = annual_property_taxes_and_insurance / 12

# The monthly mortgage payment amount (excluding taxes and insurance)
monthly_mortgage_payment_excluding_taxes_insurance = total_monthly_budget_for_mortgage_taxes_insurance - monthly_property_taxes_and_insurance

# Monthly interest rate
monthly_interest_rate = annual_interest_rate / 12

# Calculating the loan amount using the formula for the monthly payment of a mortgage
# P = (r*PV) / (1 - (1 + r)^-n), where P is the monthly payment, r is the monthly interest rate, PV is the present value (loan amount), and n is the loan term in months.
# Rearranging the formula to solve for PV (loan amount)
loan_amount = monthly_mortgage_payment_excluding_taxes_insurance * (1 - (1 + monthly_interest_rate)**-loan_term_months) / monthly_interest_rate

print(loan_amount)
# 816845.3904291481

Based on the provided information and calculations, the home loan amount, considering the total budget of $3,668.13 for mortgage, taxes, and insurance, is approximately **$816,845.39**
