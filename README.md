```python

# Initialize constants
TOTAL_MONTHLY_BUDGET = 3668.13
ANNUAL_TAX_INSURANCE_RATE_DECIMAL = 1.55 / 100  # Convert percentage to decimal
ANNUAL_INTEREST_RATE_DECIMAL = 3.5 / 100  # Convert percentage to decimal
LOAN_TERM_YEARS = 30
LOAN_TERM_MONTHS = LOAN_TERM_YEARS * 12

# Calculate the monthly cost of property tax and insurance
# Note: This calculation assumes the loan amount equals the home value
HOME_VALUE_PLACEHOLDER = 100  # Placeholder for calculating rate impact
annual_tax_and_insurance = HOME_VALUE_PLACEHOLDER * ANNUAL_TAX_INSURANCE_RATE_DECIMAL
monthly_tax_and_insurance = annual_tax_and_insurance / 12

# Calculate the monthly mortgage payment, excluding taxes and insurance
monthly_mortgage_payment_excl = TOTAL_MONTHLY_BUDGET - monthly_tax_and_insurance

# Determine the monthly interest rate
monthly_interest_rate = ANNUAL_INTEREST_RATE_DECIMAL / 12

# Calculate the loan amount using the mortgage payment formula:
# P = (r * PV) / (1 - (1 + r)^-n), where P is the monthly payment, r is the monthly interest rate,
# PV is the present value (loan amount), and n is the loan term in months.
# The formula is rearranged to solve for PV (loan amount).
loan_amount = monthly_mortgage_payment_excl * (1 - (1 + monthly_interest_rate) ** -LOAN_TERM_MONTHS) / monthly_interest_rate

# Output the calculated loan amount
print(f"Calculated Loan Amount: {loan_amount}")
# Calculated Loan Amount: 816845.3904291481

```
